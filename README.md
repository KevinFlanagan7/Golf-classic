### Fonts

I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen [Merienda](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merienda?preview.text=Golf%20Classic&query=merienda) as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look.

### Icons

I have used icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will be used where there is no explanation needed to their meaning, like the social media links and the hamburger icon for navigational links on smaller devices. Other icons are be used for style to the prize section headings.

### Colours

I have used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors") to help in the selection of my colour scheme. I changed colours as initial heading colours had poor contract with the background. After manually optimizing it improved contrast with backgroud colours used. I used coolers contrast checker, results for green background can been viewed [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-6e9075 "Adjusted colour") and for the white background can be viewed [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-f5f5f5 "Adjusted colour").

![Colour Pallet](documentation/Project_colours.png)

- #6e9075ff - This colour will be used as the main background colour.
- #F5F5F5 - This colour will be used as background behind images in prize section.
- #000000 - This colour will be used as text colour.
- #3a3a3a - This colour will be used for box shadow.

### Structure

I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the Samsung Galaxy S9 (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/).

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Features

## Existing Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is fully responsive to allow for various screen sizes. It includes links to manover around the site easily and the Golf classic header doubles as a link back to the home screen.

+ Large Desktop screens (>=1200px)
\
&nbsp;

    - Spanning the full width of the device and with all navigational links (Home, About, Gallery, Sign up (Registration page)), this gives ease and clear use to the end user.

        ![Navigation bar](documentation/navbar_large.png)

    - In order for the user to visably see which of the links they are hovering over there is a bar below the text.

        ![Navigation bar on hover](documentation/navbar_large_hover.png)
\
&nbsp;
    
    
+ iPad devices (<992px)
\
&nbsp;
        
    - Like the desktop this also spans the full width of the device and with all navigational links (Home, About, Gallery, Sign up (Registration page)).

        ![Nav bar on iPad devices](documentation/navbar_large.png)
\

- Phone devises (>768px)
\
&nbsp;
        
    - To save screen space the navigational menu takes on the burger style.

        ![Navigation bar](documentation/navbar_large_small.png)

    - When pressed, it opens up the main menu with all the links available.

# Testing

The site responds nicely to all different screen sizes, the images look sharp on all device sizes with very little, large blank spaces. It allows the user to navigate around easily and aslo make contact via the sign up form or social media links. The content is simple and to the point.

- I had issues with the navigation menu bar when testing as it was scrolling too far past the About, Gallery and Registration sections. After some research on the internet I found the scroll-padding-top code which i used to resolve the problem. 
- While researching for the above problem I also found the scroll behavior code and also used this and set it to smooth for a better user experience.
- I found that I was repeating a lot of code in my style.css file. I created more classes in my index.html file which reduced my style.css code by nearly 100 lines and improved the lighthouse performance results.
- When I was validating index.html file, I had 2 errors showing. It reported that two sections (Registration and location map) were missing headings. I added headings and a class to these sections and then set up a style rule to hide the headings class in style.css.
- The results of my validation for html and css files are below.
    - HTML (index.html) validator [results](documentation/index.html.png)
    - HTML (signup.html) validator [results](documentation/signup.html.png)
    - CSS validator [results](documentation/style.css.png)
- Lighthouse tests for mobile [results](documentation/lighthouse_mobile.png)
- Lighthouse tests for desktop [results](documentation/lighthouse_desktop.png)

- Using Mobile Simulator extension in Google Chrome I have tested the website on differite devices. Test results are listed below.

| Device                | Responsive >=768px | Responsive <768px | Links/URLs work | Images Work   |

| Desktop > 1200px      | Good               | N/A               | Passed          | Passed        |


## Unfixed Bugs

The Hamburger menu selector for smaller devices does not close when a menu is selected. To enable this it would need JavaScript which I have not covered yet.
