### Fonts

I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen [Merienda](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merienda?preview.text=Golf%20Classic&query=merienda) as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look.

### Icons

I have used icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will be used where there is no explanation needed to their meaning, like the social media links and the hamburger icon for navigational links on smaller devices. Other icons are be used for style to the prize section headings.

### Colours

I have used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors") to help in the selection of my colour scheme. I changed colours as initial heading colours had poor contract with the background. After manually optimizing it improved contrast with backgroud colours used. I used coolers contrast checker, results for green background can been viewed [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-6e9075 "Adjusted colour") and for the white background can be viewed [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-f5f5f5 "Adjusted colour").

![Colour Pallet](documentation/Project_colours.png)

- #6e9075ff - This colour will be used as the main background colour.
- #F5F5F5 - This colour will be used as background behind images in prize section.
- #000000 - This colour will be used as text colour.
- #3a3a3a - This colour will be used for box shadow.

### Structure
