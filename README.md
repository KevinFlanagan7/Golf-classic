### Fonts

I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen [Merienda](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merienda?preview.text=Golf%20Classic&query=merienda) as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look.

### Icons

I have used icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will be used where there is no explanation needed to their meaning, like the social media links and the hamburger icon for navigational links on smaller devices. Other icons are be used for style to the prize section headings.

### Colours

I have used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors") to help in the selection of my colour scheme. I changed colours as initial heading colours had poor contract with the background. After manually optimizing it improved contrast with backgroud colours used. I used coolers contrast checker, results for green background can been viewed [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-6e9075 "Adjusted colour") and for the white background can be viewed [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-f5f5f5 "Adjusted colour").

![Colour Pallet](documentation/Project_colours.png)

- #6e9075ff - This colour will be used as the main background colour.
- #F5F5F5 - This colour will be used as background behind images in prize section.
- #000000 - This colour will be used as text colour.
- #3a3a3a - This colour will be used for box shadow.

### Structure

I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the Samsung Galaxy S9 (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/).

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Features

## Existing Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is fully responsive to allow for various screen sizes. It includes links to manover around the site easily and the Golf classic header doubles as a link back to the home screen.

+ Large Desktop screens (>=992px)
\
&nbsp;

    - Spanning the full width of the device and with all navigational links (Home, About, Gallery, Sign up (Registration page)), this gives ease and clear use to the end user.

        ![Navigation bar](documentation/navbar_large.png)

    - In order for the user to visably see which of the links they are hovering over there is a bar below the text.

        ![Navigation bar on hover](documentation/navbar_large_hover.png)
\
&nbsp;
    
    
+ iPad devices (<992px)
\
&nbsp;
        
    - Like the desktop this also spans the full width of the device and with all navigational links (Home, About, Gallery, Sign up (Registration page)).

        ![Nav bar on iPad devices](documentation/navbar_large.png)
\
&nbsp;


- Phone devises (>768px)
\
&nbsp;
        
    - To save screen space the navigational menu takes on the burger style.

        ![Navigation bar](documentation/navbar_large_small.png)

    - When pressed, it opens up the main menu with all the links available.

### Landing Page

+ The landing page image
    - The image gives the user instant knowledge of what is involved in the site, and with the high defintion of the foreground it draws their eye to the golf ball in the grass and the cover text box.

    - The text gives instant information to the user on what the competetion is and when it is on.
